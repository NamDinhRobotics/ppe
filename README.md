This plane extraction algorithm takes an organized 3-D point cloud as input and outputs a set of planes that approximate the geometry underlying the point cloud.

## How to extract planes

To extract planes from an organized point cloud, use the function [`pcextrpln`](./matlab/pcextrpln.m).
For details about how to use [`pcextrpln`](./matlab/pcextrpln.m), please refer to the detailed documentation in the function header.

## [The synthetic plane extraction benchmark](http://synpeb.cs.uni-freiburg.de/)

While testing our plane extraction algorithm and comparing it to other methods, we found out that the well established SegComp dataset exhibits several deficiencies, which are described in our paper.
In order to create a new strong baseline, we created the synthetic plane extraction benchmark: SynPEB.
The SynPEB dataset can be downloaded at [http://synpeb.cs.uni-freiburg.de/](http://synpeb.cs.uni-freiburg.de/).

## How to repeat our experiments

To verify our experimental results, please download SegComp and SynPEB.
Then, navigate to the `matlab/experiments` folder.
By running the script [`runexp.m`](./matlab/experiments/runexp.m), you perform the experiments.
To trigger the automatic evaluation of the data generated during the experiments, please start the script [`evalexp.m`](./matlab/experiments/evalexp.m).
The script [`ploteval.m`](./matlab/experiments/ploteval.m) finally visualizes the evaluation results.

In order to accelerate the plane extraction process, it is recommended to compile the CUDA code in the `gpufit` folder.
For instructions, see the corresponding [readme file](./gpufit/README.md).
